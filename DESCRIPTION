Description: ExCluster flattens Ensembl and GENCODE GTF files into GFF files,
    which are used to count reads per non-overlapping exon bin from BAM files.
    This read counting is done using the function featureCounts from the package
    Rsubread. Library sizes are normalized across all biological replicates, and
    ExCluster then compares two different conditions to detect signifcantly 
    differentially spliced genes. This process requires at least two independent
    biological repliates per condition, and ExCluster accepts only exactly two
    conditions at a time. ExCluster ultimately produces false discovery rates
    (FDRs) per gene, which are used to detect significance. Exon log2 fold
    change (log2FC) means and variances may be plotted for each significantly 
    differentially spliced gene, which helps scientists develop hypothesis and
    target differential splicing events for RT-qPCR validation in the wet lab.
